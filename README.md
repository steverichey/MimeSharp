MIME type handling utility for C#. It includes all mime types and extensions curated by Apache located at:
[http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types)
Includes all 600+ types and 800+ extensions defined by the Apache project.
Allows user to lookup mime type by filename, get file extensions for mime types.

## Install

### NuGet Package
```
PM> Install-Package MimeSharp
```
https://www.nuget.org/packages/MimeSharp/

Or simply download the MimeSharp.1.0.0.nupkg and use it.

### Reference the dll
Get the ```MimeSharp.dll``` from ```dist``` folder and copy to your references folder and reference in your project. Now, you're reading to use it.

### Using source files
Simply copy ```Mime.cs``` and ```ApacheMimeTypes.cs``` to your project and use as any other class.

## Usage
Example usage in the console application ```Program.cs```

### mime.Lookup(filePath)
Get the mime type associated with a file, if no mime type is found `application/octet-stream` is returned. Performs a case-insensitive lookup using the extension in `filePath` (the substring after the last '/' or '.').  E.g.

```csharp
var mime = new Mime();

mime.Lookup(@"song.ogg"));
mime.Lookup(@"picture.jpg"));
```

Output
```
audio/ogg
image/jpeg
```

### mime.DefaultType
When no mime type is found. Default is `application/octet-stream`.

### mime.Extension(mimeType)
Get all the extension for `mimeType`. Gives you a list `IList<string>` of extensions. Empty list if no mime type is found.

```csharp
var mime = new Mime();

mime.Extension("audio/ogg");
mime.Extension("image/jpeg")
mime.Extension("text/html")
```

Output
```
["oga","ogg","spx"]
["jpeg","jpg","jpe"]
["html","htm"]
```

## Adding new mime type
Even though I don't recommend adding your MIME type if you really have to do it, use the project from ```MimeSharp.FromFile``` directory and change the ```MimeTypes/mime.types``` file or even create new file and modify the source code.
